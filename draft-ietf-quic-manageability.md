This document discusses manageability of the QUIC transport protocol, focusing
on caveats impacting network operations involving QUIC traffic. Its intended
audience is network operators, as well as content providers that rely on the use
of QUIC-aware middleboxes, e.g. for load balancing.

# Introduction

QUIC {{?QUIC-TRANSPORT=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} is a new transport protocol
currently under development in the IETF quic working group, focusing on
support of semantics as needed for HTTP/2 {{?QUIC-HTTP=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.
Based on current deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP and
encrypted by default. The current version of QUIC integrates TLS
{{?QUIC-TLS=I-D.ietf-quic-tls}} to encrypt all payload data and most control
information. Given QUIC is an end-to-end transport protocol, all information
in the protocol header, even that which can be inspected, is is not meant to
be mutable by the network, and is therefore integrity-protected to the extent
possible.

This document provides guidance for network operation on the management of QUIC
traffic. This includes guidance on how to interpret and utilize information that
is exposed by QUIC to the network as well as explaining requirement and
assumptions that the QUIC protocol design takes toward the expected network
treatment. It also discusses how common network management practices will be
impacted by QUIC.

Of course, network management is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour: practices
considered necessary or even mandatory within enterprise networks with certain
compliance requirements, for example, would be impermissible on other networks
without those requirements. This document therefore does not make any specific
recommendations as to which practices should or should not be applied; for each
practice, it describes what is and is not possible with the QUIC transport
protocol as defined.

QUIC is at the moment very much a moving target. This document refers the state
of the QUIC working group drafts as well as to changes under discussion, via
issues and pull requests in GitHub current as of the time of writing.

## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they have a special meaning
as defined in {{!RFC2119}}.

# Features of the QUIC Wire Image {#sec-wire-image}

In this section, we discusses those aspects of the QUIC transport protocol
that have an impact on the design and operation of devices that forward QUIC
packets. Here, we are concerned primarily with QUIC's unencrypted wire image
{{?WIRE-IMAGE=I-D.trammell-wire-image}}, which we define as the information
available in the packet header in each QUIC packet, and the dynamics of that
information. Since QUIC is a versioned protocol, the wire image of the header
format can also change from version to version. However, at least the
mechanism by which a receiver can determine which version is used and the
meaning and location of fields used in the version negotiation process is
invariant {{?QUIC-INVARIANTS=I-D.ietf-quic-invariants}}.

This document is focused on the protocol as presently defined in
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} and {{?QUIC-TLS}}, and will change to track
those documents.

## QUIC Packet Header Structure {#public-header}

QUIC packets may have either a long header, or a short header. The first bit
of the QUIC header indicates which type of header is present.

The long header exposes more information. It is used during connection
establishment, including version negotiation, server retry, and 0-RTT data. It
contains a version number, as well as source and destination connection IDs
for grouping packets belonging to the same flow. The definition and location
of these fields in the QUIC long header are invariant for future versions of
QUIC, although future versions of QUIC may provide additional fields in the
long header {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}}.

Short headers are used after connection establishment. The only information
they contain for inspection on the path is an optional, variable-length
destination connection ID.

As of draft version 13 of the QUIC transport document, the following
information may be exposed in QUIC packet headers:

- header type: the long header has a 7-bit packet type field following the
  Header Form bit. Header types correspond to stages of the handshake; see
  Section 4.1 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

- version number: The version number is present in the long header, and
  identifies the version used for that packet. Note that during Version
  Negotiation (see {{version}}, and Section 4.3 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, the
  version number field has a special value (0x00000000) that identifies the
  packet as a Version Negotiation packet.

- source and destination connection ID: The source and destination connection
  IDs are variable-length fields that can be used to identify the connection
  associated with a QUIC packet, for load-balancing and NAT rebinding
  purposes; see {{sec-loadbalancing}} and {{rebinding}}. The source connection
  ID corresponds to the destination connection ID the source would like to
  have on packets sent to it, and is only present on long packet headers. The
  destination connection ID, if present, is present on both long and short
  header packets. On long header packets, the length of the connection IDs is
  also present; on short header packets, the length of the destination
  connection ID is implicit.

- length: the length of the remaining quic packet after the length field,
  present on
  long headers. This field is used to implement coalesced packets during the
  handshake (see {{coalesced}}).

- packet number: Every packet has an associated packet number; however, this
  packet number is encrypted, and therefore not of use to on-path observers.
  This packet number has a fixed location and length in long headers, and an
  implicit location and encrypted variable length in short headers.

- key phase: The Key Phase bit, present in short headers identifies the key
  used to encrypt the packet during key rotation.

## Coalesced Packets {#coalesced}

Multiple QUIC packets may be coalesced into a UDP datagram, with a datagram
carrying one or more long header packets followed by zero or one short header
packets. When packets are coalesced, the Length fields in the long headers are
used to separate QUIC packets. The length header field is variable length and
its position in the header is also variable depending on the length of the
source and destionation connection ID. See Section 4.6 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

## Use of Port Numbers

Applications that have a mapping for TCP as well as QUIC are expected to
use the same port number for both services. However, as with
TCP-based services, especially when application layer information is
encrypted, there is no guarantee that a specific application will use the
registered port, or the used port is carrying traffic belonging to the
respective registered service. For example, {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} specifies
the use of Alt-Svc for discovery of QUIC/HTTP services on other ports.

Further, as QUIC has a connection ID, it is also possible to maintain multiple
QUIC connections over one 5-tuple. However, if the connection ID is not present
in the packet header, all packets of the 5-tuple belong to the same QUIC
connection.

## The QUIC handshake {#handshake}

New QUIC connections are established using a handshake, which is distinguishable
on the wire and contains some information that can be passively observed.

To illustrate the information visible in the QUIC wire image during the
handshake, we first show the general communication pattern visible in the UDP
datagams containing the QUIC handshake, then examine each of the datagrams in
detail.

In the nominal case, the QUIC handshake can be recognized on the wire through at
least four datagrams we'll call "QUIC Client Hello", "QUIC Server Hello", and
"Initial Completion", and "Handshake Completion", for purposes of this
illustration, as shown in {{fig-handshake}}.

Packets in the handshake belong to three separate cryptographic and transport
contexts ("Initial", which contains observable payload, and "Handshake" and
"1-RTT", which do not). QUIC packets in separate contexts during the handshake
are generally coalesced (see {{coalesced}}) in order to reduce the number of UDP
datagrams sent during the handshake.

As shown here, the client can send 0-RTT data as soon as it has sent its Client
Hello, and the server can send 1-RTT data as soon as it has sent its Server
Hello.

{: #fig-handshake
   title="General communication pattern visible in the QUIC handshake"}

A typical handshake starts with the client sending of a QUIC Client Hello
datagram as shown in {{fig-client-hello}}, which elicits a QUIC Server Hello
datagram as shown in {{fig-server-hello}} typically containing three packets:
an Initial packet with the Server Hello, a Handshake packet with the rest of
the server's side of the TLS handshake, and initial 1-RTT data, if present.

The content of QUIC Initial packets are encrypted using Initial Secrets, which
are derived from a per-version constant and the client's destination connection
ID; they are therefore observable by any on-path device that knows the
per-version constant; we therefore consider these as visible in our
illustration. The content of QUIC Handshake packets are encrypted using keys
established during the initial handshake exchange, and are therefore not
visible.

Initial, Handshake, and the Short Header packets transmitted after the handshake
belong to cryptographic and transport contexts. The Initial Completion
{{fig-init-complete}} and the Handshake Completion {{fig-hs-complete}} datagrams
finish these first two contexts, by sending the final acknowledgment and
finishing the transmission of CRYPTO frames.

The Client Hello datagram exposes version number, source and destination
connection IDs, and information in the TLS Client Hello message, including any
TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) present, in the clear. The QUIC PADDING frame
shown here may be present to ensure the Client Hello datagram has a minumum size
of 1200 octets, to mitigate the possibility of handshake amplification. Note
that the location of PADDING is implementation-dependent, and PADDING frames may
not appear in the Initial packet in a coalesced packet.

The Initial Completion datagram does not expose any additional information;

(see {{sec-confirm}}), and for three-way handshake RTT estimation as in
{{sec-rtt}}.

Similar to Initial Competion, Handshake Completion also exposes no additional

completed.

When the client uses 0-RTT connection resumption, 0-RTT data may also be
seen in the QUIC Client Hello datagram, as shown in {{fig-client-hello-0rtt}}.

~~~~~
{: #fig-client-hello-0rtt
   title="Typical 0-RTT QUIC Client Hello datagram pattern"}

In a 0-RTT QUIC Client Hello datagram, the PADDING frame is only present if
necessary to increase the size of the datagram with 0RTT data to at least 1200
bytes. Additional datagrams containing only 0-RTT protected long header packets
may be sent from the client to the server after the Client Hello datagram,
containing the rest of the 0-RTT data. The amount of 0-RTT protected data is
limited by the initial congestion window, typically around 10 packets
{{?RFC6928}}.

## Integrity Protection of the Wire Image {#wire-integrity}

As soon as the cryptographic context is established, all information in the QUIC
header, including information exposed in the packet header, is integrity
protected. Further, information that was sent and exposed in handshake packets
sent before the cryptographic context was established are validated later during
the cryptographic handshake.  Therefore, devices on path MUST NOT change any
information or bits in QUIC packet headers, since alteration of header
information will lead to a failed integrity check at the receiver, and can even
lead to connection termination.

## Connection ID and Rebinding {#rebinding}

The connection ID in the QUIC packet headers allows routing of QUIC packets at
load balancers on other than five-tuple information, ensuring that related
flows are appropriately balanced together; and to allow rebinding of a
connection after one of the endpoint's addresses changes - usually the
client's, in the case of the HTTP binding. Client and server negotiate
connection IDs during the handshake; typically, however, only the server will
request a connection ID for the lifetime of the connection. Connection IDs for
either endpoint may change during the lifetime of a connection, with the new
connection ID being negotiated via encrypted frames. See Section 6.1 of
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.


## Packet Numbers {#packetnumber}

The packet number field is always present in the QUIC packet header; however,
it is always encrypted. The encryption key for packet number protection on
handshake packets sent before cryptographic context establishment is specific
to the QUIC version, while packet number protection on subsequent packets uses
secrets derived from the end-to-end cryptographic context. Packet numbers are
therefore not part of the wire image that is useful to on-path observers.


## Version Negotiation and Greasing {#version}

Version negotiation is not protected, given the used protection mechanism can
change with the version.  However, the choices provided in the list of version
in the Version Negotiation packet will be validated as soon as the cryptographic
context has been established. Therefore any manipulation of this list will be
detected and will cause the endpoints to terminate the connection.

Also note that the list of versions in the Version Negotiation packet may
contain reserved versions. This mechanism is used to avoid ossification in the
implementation on the selection mechanism. Further, a client may send a Initial
Client packet with a reserved version number to trigger version negotiation. In
the Version Negotiation packet the connection ID and packet number of the Client
Initial packet are reflected to provide a proof of return-routability. Therefore
changing these information will also cause the connection to fail.

# Network-visible information about QUIC flows

This section addresses the different kinds of observations and inferences that
can be made about QUIC flows by a passive observer in the network based on the
wire image in {{sec-wire-image}}. Here we assume a bidirectional observer (one
that can see packets in both directions in the sequence in which they are
carried on the wire) unless noted.

## Identifying QUIC traffic {#sec-identifying}

The QUIC wire image is not specifically designed to be distinguishable from
other UDP traffic.

The only application binding currently defined for QUIC is HTTP
{{?QUIC-HTTP}}. HTTP over QUIC uses UDP port 443 by default,
although URLs referring to resources available over HTTP over QUIC may specify
alternate port numbers. Simple assumptions about whether a given flow is using
QUIC based upon a UDP port number may therefore not hold; see also {{?RFC7605}}
section 5.

### Identifying Negotiated Version

An in-network observer assuming that a set of packets belongs to a QUIC flow
can infer the version number in use by observing the handshake: an Initial
packet with a given version from a client to which a server responds with an
Initial packet with the same version implies acceptance of that version.

Negotiated version cannot be identified for flows for which a handshake is not
observed, such as in the case of NAT rebinding; however, these flows can be
associated with flows for which a version has been identified; see
{{sec-flow-association}}.

In the rest of this section, we discuss only packets belonging to Version 1 QUIC
flows, and assume that these packets have been identified as such through the
observation of a version negotiation.

### Rejection of Garbage Traffic {#sec-garbage}

A related question is whether a first packet of a given flow on known
QUIC-associated port is a valid QUIC packet, in order to support in-network
filtering of garbage UDP packets (reflection attacks, random backscatter). While
heuristics based on the first byte of the packet (packet type) could be used to
separate valid from invalid first packet types, the deployment of such
heuristics is not recommended, as packet types may have different meanings in
future versions of the protocol.

## Connection confirmation {#sec-confirm}

Connection establishment uses Initial, Handshake, and Retry packets containing a
TLS handshake. Connection establishment can therefore be detected using
heuristics similar to those used to detect TLS over TCP. A client using 0-RTT
connection may also send data packets in 0-RTT Protected packets directly after
the Initial packet containing the TLS Client Hello. Since these packets may be
reordered in the network, note that 0-RTT Protected data packets may be seen
before the Initial packet. Note that only clients send Initial packets, so the
sides of a connection can be distinguished by QUIC packet type in the handshake.

## Application Identification {#sec-server}

The cleartext TLS handshake may contain Server Name Indication (SNI)
{{?RFC6066}}, by which the client reveals the name of the server it intends to
connect to, in order to allow the server to present a certificate based on
that name. It may also contain information from Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN) {{?RFC7301}}, by which the client exposes the names of
application-layer protocols it supports; an observer can deduce that one of
those protocols will be used if the connection continues.

Work is currently underway in the TLS working group to encrypt the SNI in TLS
1.3 {{?TLS-ENCRYPT-SNI=I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption}}, reducing the information
available in the SNI to the name of a fronting service, which can generally be
identified by the IP address of the server anyway. If used with QUIC, this
would make SNI-based application identification impossible through passive
measurement.

## Flow association {#sec-flow-association}

The QUIC Connection ID (see {{rebinding}}) is designed to allow an on-path
device such as a load-balancer to associate two flows as identified by
five-tuple when the address and port of one of the endpoints changes; e.g. due
to NAT rebinding or server IP address migration. An observer keeping flow state
can associate a connection ID with a given flow, and can associate a known flow
with a new flow when when observing a packet sharing a connection ID and one
endpoint address (IP address and port) with the known flow.

The connection ID to be used for a long-running flow is chosen by the server
(see {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} section 5.6) during the handshake. This value should
be treated
as opaque; see {{sec-loadbalancing}} for caveats regarding connection ID
selection at servers.

## Flow teardown {#sec-teardown}

The QUIC does not expose the end of a connection; the only indication to on-path
devices that a flow has ended is that packets are no longer observed. Stateful
devices on path such as NATs and firewalls must therefore use idle timeouts to
determine when to drop state for QUIC flows.

Changes to this behavior have been discussed in the working group, but there
is no current proposal to implement these changes:  see
https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/602.

## Round-trip time measurement {#sec-rtt}

Round-trip time of QUIC flows can be inferred by observation once per flow,
during the handshake, as in passive TCP measurement; this requires parsing of
the QUIC packet header and recognition of the handshake, as illustrated in
{{handshake}}.

In the common case, the delay between the Initial packet containing the TLS
Client Hello and the Handshake packet containing the TLS Server Hello
represents the RTT component on the path between the observer and the server.
The delay between the TLS Server Hello and the Handshake packet containing the
TLS Finished message sent by the client represents the RTT component on the
path between the observer and the client. While the client may send 0-RTT
Protected packets after the Initial packet during 0-RTT connection
re-establishment, these can be ignored for RTT measurement purposes.

Handshake RTT can be measured by adding the client-to-observer and
observer-to-server RTT components together. This measurement necessarily
includes any transport and application layer delay at both sides.

The spin bit experiment, detailed in {{?QUIC-SPIN=I-D.ietf-quic-spin-exp}},
provides an additional method to measure intraflow per-flow RTT.  When a QUIC
flow is sending at full rate (i.e., neither application nor flow control
limited), the latency spin bit described in that document changes value once
per round-trip time (RTT). An on-path observer can observe the time difference
between edges in the spin bit signal in a single direction to measure one
sample of end-to-end RTT. Note that this measurement, as with passive RTT
measurement for TCP, includes any transport protocol delay (e.g., delayed
sending of acknowledgements) and/or application layer delay (e.g., waiting for
a request to complete). It therefore provides devices on path a good
instantaneous estimate of the RTT as experienced by the application. A simple
linear smoothing or moving minimum filter can be applied to the stream of RTT
information to get a more stable estimate.

An on-path observer that can see traffic in both directions (from client to
server and from server to client) can also use the spin bit to measure
"upstream" and "downstream" component RTT; i.e, the component of the
end-to-end RTT attributable to the paths between the observer and the server
and the observer and the client, respectively. It does this by measuring the
delay between a spin edge observed in the upstream direction and that observed
in the downstream direction, and vice versa.

Application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can have application and
transport layer delay, respectively, that are much greater than network RTT.
Therefore, the spin bit provides network latency information only when the
sender is neither application nor flow control limited. When the sender is
application-limited by periodic application traffic, where that period is
longer than the RTT, measuring the spin bit provides information about the
application period, not the RTT. Simple heuristics based on the observed data
rate per flow or changes in the RTT series can be used to reject bad RTT
samples due to application or flow control limitation.

Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples on packets
that advance the largest packet number seen, signal generation itself is
resistant to reordering. However, reordering can cause problems at an observer
by causing spurious edge detection and therefore low RTT estimates, if
reordering occurs across a spin bit flip in the stream. This can be
probabilistically mitigated by the observer also tracking the low-order bits
of the packet number, and rejecting edges that appear out-of-order
{{?RFC4737}}.

The Spin bit MAY be disabled for servers and clients where the RTT would reveal
the presence of a VPN or proxy.

## Flow symmetry measurement {#sec-symmetry}

QUIC explicitly exposes which side of a connection is a client and which side is
a server during the handshake. In addition, the symmerty of a flow (whether
primarily client-to-server, primarily server-to-client, or roughly
bidirectional, as input to basic traffic classification techniques) can be
inferred through the measurement of data rate in each direction. While QUIC
traffic is protected and ACKS may be padded, padding is not required.

# Specific Network Management Tasks

In this section, we address specific network management and measurement
techniques and how QUIC's design impacts them.

## Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic {#sec-stateful}

Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic is possible through QUIC traffic and version
identification ({{sec-identifying}}) and observation of the handshake for
connection confirmation ({{sec-confirm}}). The lack of any visible end-of-flow
signal ({{sec-teardown}}) means that this state must be purged either through
timers or through least-recently-used eviction, depending on application
requirements.

## Passive network performance measurement and troubleshooting

Limited RTT measurement is possible by passive observation of QUIC traffic;
see {{sec-rtt}}. No passive measurement of loss is possible with the present
wire image. Extremely limited observation of upstream congestion may be
possible via the observation of CE markings on ECN-enabled QUIC traffic.

## Server cooperation with load balancers {#sec-loadbalancing}

In the case of content distribution networking architectures including load
balancers, the connection ID provides a way for the server to signal information
about the desired treatment of a flow to the load balancers. Guidance on
assigning connection IDs is given in
{{?QUIC-APPLICABILITY=I-D.ietf-quic-applicability}}.

## DDoS Detection and Mitigation {#sec-ddos-dec}

Current practices in detection and mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks generally involve passive measurement using network flow data
{{?RFC7011}}, classification of traffic into "good" (productive) and "bad" (DoS)
flows, and filtering of these bad flows in a "scrubbing" environment. Key to
successful DDoS mitigation is efficient classification of this traffic.

Limited first-packet garbage detection as in {{sec-garbage}} and stateful
tracking of QUIC traffic as in {{sec-stateful}} above can be used in this
classification step.

Note that the use of a connection ID to support connection migration renders
5-tuple based filtering insufficient, and requires more state to be maintained
by DDoS defense systems, and linkability resistance in connection ID update
mechanisms means that a connection ID aware DDoS defense system must have the
same information about flows as the load balancer.

However, it is questionable if connection migrations needs to be supported in
a DDOS attack. If the connection migration is not visible to the network that
performs the DDoS detection, an active, migrated QUIC connection may be
blocked by such a system under attack. However, a defense system might simply
rely on the fast resumption mechanism provided by QUIC.

## QoS support and ECMP

\[EDITOR'S NOTE: this is a bit speculative; keep?]

QUIC does not provide any additional information on requirements on Quality of
Service (QoS) provided from the network. QUIC assumes that all packets with the
same 5-tuple {dest addr, source addr, protocol, dest port, source port} will
receive similar network treatment.  That means all stream that are multiplexed
over the same QUIC connection require the same network treatment and are handled
by the same congestion controller. If differential network treatment is desired,
multiple QUIC connections to the same server might be used, given that
establishing a new connection using 0-RTT support is cheap and fast.

QoS mechanisms in the network MAY also use the connection ID for service
differentiation, as a change of connection ID is bound to a change of address
which anyway is likely to lead to a re-route on a different path with different
network characteristics.

Given that QUIC is more tolerant of packet re-ordering than TCP (see
{{packetnumber}}), Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP) does not necessarily
need to be flow based.  However, 5-tuple (plus eventually connection ID if
present) matching is still beneficial for QoS given all packets are handled by
the same congestion controller.

This document has no actions for IANA.

# Security Considerations

Supporting manageability of QUIC traffic inherently involves tradeoffs with the
confidentiality of QUIC's control information; this entire document is therefore
security-relevant.
